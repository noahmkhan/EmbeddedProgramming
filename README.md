# RED AND GREEN LED (PSoC 6)

THIS PROJECT CONTAINS 3 PARTS

1.1 AND 1.2 FUNCTION THE SAME BUT HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS.

WHEN EITHER PART 1 OR PART 2 IS UPLOADED TO THE MICROCONTROLLER, THE 2 LEDS LIGHT UP. ONE IS PIN 3 ON PORT 6 AND THE OTHER IS PIN 1 ON PORT 7. THE BOARD HAS THEM LABELED AS (G) AND (R) FOR GREEN AND RED, RESPECTIVELY. THE PINS WILL GO HIGH AND LOW FOR ONE CYCLE (1Hz). ADDITIONALLY, THE 2 LEDS WILL ALTERNATE. WHEN THE RED LED GOES HIGH, THE GREEN LED WILL GO LOW AND WHEN THE RED LED GOES LOW, THE GREEN LED GOES HIGH.

IMPLEMENTATOIN FOR 1.1 AND 1.2
1.1 USES PULSE WIDTH MODULATION (PWM). THE PROGRAM MUST INITIALIZE, ENABLE, AND BEGIN THE PROCESS (TRIGGER START). THESE STEPS MUST BE DONE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PINS MENTIONED ABOVE. THE SOURCE BEGINS BY INITIALIZING THE THE COUNTER IN THE TCPWM BLOCK. INITIALIZATION REQUIRES THE POINTER TO A TCPWM INSTANCE, THE COUNTER INSTANCE IN THE SELECTED TCPMW, AND THE POINTER TO A CONFIGURATION STRUCTURE. NEXT, THE COUNTER IN THE TCPWM BLOCK FOR THE PWM OPERATION NEEDS TO BE ENABLED. IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE COUNTER WE NEED THE POINTER TO A TCPWM INSTANCE AND THE COUNTER INSTANCE NUMBER IN THE SELECTED TCPMW. LASTLY, WE TRIGGER A SOFTWARE START ON THE SELECTED TCPWMS. TO DO THIS WE NEED THE POINTER TO THE TCPWM INSTANCE AND THE BIT FIELD REPRESENTING EACH COUNTER IN THE TCPWM BLOCK.

ANY INSTANCE CAN BE FOUND IN DEVICE CONFIGURATOR > PINS > CODE PREVIEW

1.2 WRITES TO THE GENERAL PURPOSES INPUT AND OUTPUT PINS (GPIO PINS). THIS IMPLEMENTATION WRITES A 0 OR 1 STATE TO THE OUTPUT DRIVER. IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE USE THE POINTER TO THE PIN'S PORT REGISTER BASE ADDRESS, THE POSITION OF THE PIN BIT-FIELD WITHIN THE PORT REGISTER, AND THE LOGIC LEVEL WE WOULD LIKE TO DRIVE TO THE PIN. IN SUMMERY, WE DIRVE THE RED PIN LOW AND THE GREEN PIN HIGH FOR HALF A CYCLE, THEN DRIVE THE RED PIN HIGH AND THE GREEN PIN LOW FOR A HALF CYCLE. THIS LOGIC IS PLACED IN AN ENDLESS LOOP TO REMAIN CONTINUOUS.

FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, 1.1 MANIPULATES HARDWARE WHEREAS 1.2 TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE DIGITAL CAPABILITES. 1.2 IS FAR MORE SIMPLER COMPARED TO 1.1.

1.3 USES FUNCTIONS AND GPIO PINS. THE FUNCTIONS ARE CREATED INTO TASKS AND ARE CALLED USING THE TASK SCHEDULER FUNCTION. FOR THIS PART, THE RED LED BLINKS AT 1Hz WHILE THE GREEN LED BLINKS AT 5Hz.
